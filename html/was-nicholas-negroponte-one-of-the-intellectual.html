     <p><strong>Was Nicholas Negroponte, one of the intellectual fathers of cyber-utopianism,</strong> correct when he predicted in 1995 that &#8220;[on the Internet] there will be no more room for nationalism than there is for smallpox&#8221;? The evidence for such sweeping claims is thin. In fact, quite the opposite may have happened.</p> 
     <div class="quote-content"> 
      <p><strong>(&#8230;) the introduction of computers into the workforce</strong> failed to produce expected productivity gains (Tetris was, perhaps, part of some secret Soviet plot to halt the capitalist economy). The Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow quipped that &#8220;one can see the computer age everywhere but not in the productivity statistics!&#8221; Part of the problem in predicting the exact economic and social effects of a technology lies in the uncertainty associated with the scale on which such a technology would be used. The first automobiles were heralded as technologies that could make cities cleaner by liberating them of horse manure. The by-products of the internal combustion engine may be more palatable than manure, but given the ubiquity of automobiles in today&#8217;s world, they have solved one problem only by making another one&#8212;pollution&#8212;much worse. In other words, the future uses of a particular technology can often be described by that old adage &#8220;It&#8217;s the economy, stupid.</p> 
      <p><em>I&#8217;m seeing Evgeny Morozov quotes everywhere lately. I haven&#8217;t read the book but it certainly sounds quotable. However, upon closer reading most of the quotes prove to be Gladwellian sleight-of-hand making one argument (i.e. Morozov&#8217;s) seem smart by making something else look naive and stupid. Sure, Negroponte and other utopians might have overstated a point or three, but that doesn&#8217;t make Morozov&#8217;s arguments right by inference.</em></p> 
      <p><em>Does he really believe we would be more productive without computers just because it&#8217;s easy to waste time on Tetris? Saying that a car is no different than horse-and-carriage because they both pollute (true) surely overlooks quite a few aspects of car technology besides pollution? -m]</em></p>
