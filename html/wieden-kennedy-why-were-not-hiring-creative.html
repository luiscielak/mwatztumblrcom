    <h3>Wieden+Kennedy: Why We're Not Hiring Creative Technologists</h3>
    <div class="date">

    <div id="contentMain"> 
     <p>Wieden+Kennedy (via Creative Technology Director +Igor Clark ) <a href="http://blog.wk.com/2011/10/21/why-we-are-not-hiring-creative-technologists/">says they&#8217;re not hiring Creative Technologists</a> in a somewhat holier-(or-at-least-smarter)-than-thou blog post. Here&#8217;s the first paragraph:</p> 
     <blockquote> 
      <img width="450" src="images/102011programming.jpg" /> 
      <p>I&#8217;ve pretty much had it with the term &#8220;Creative Technology&#8221;. I&#8217;m a &#8220;Creative Technology Director&#8221; myself, and even I&#8217;m over it: already it seems clich&eacute;d at best, and at worst, bordering on the meaningless. Here&#8217;s why.[&#8230;] <br /> - Igor Clark, Creative Technology Director, W+K</p> 
     </blockquote> 
     <p>At first glance it comes across as an elitist dismissal of n00bs straight out of the recent mill of &#8220;creative tech&#8221; aka Interaction Design aka whatever degree schools. But then it seems to strike back at the agency complex for not understanding the complexity of digital, ending with what seems like a cry for a nobler, smarter breed of people who can &#8220;code up a storm&#8221;. And don&#8217;t call them creative technologists, please.</p> 
     <p>I am not sure what to make of this except possibly a disgust with the creative coding hype and the rush of schools to cash in on same - a disgust that is perfectly understandable. This field is wide open for interpretation, and not always in a good way. As with Web 1.0 painful and shallow cliches abound, and apparently &#8220;ninja dust&#8221; won&#8217;t cut it. But Clark presents no real alternatives, and I wonder how he imagines we&#8217;ll transition to a stable, mature field of computational design without finding ways to develop the people he&#8217;s looking for.</p> 
     <p>The elephant in the room here is that there are still probably only a few thousand people worldwide who meet the criteria Clark sets - i.e. critical, experienced creatives who understand creative solutions and who can write decent code. There has been a noticeable growth in the last few years, but it&#8217;s linear rather than exponential. And I would say it&#8217;s happening more just as much because of the DIY creative technology movement as the numerous schools now offering computational creativity foundation classes.</p> 
     <p>So if Clark is throwing down a glove, I wonder who it&#8217;s intended for. If it&#8217;s aimed at short-sighted agency people and schools cashing in on a fad, that&#8217;s fair game in my opinion. But if so I&#8217;m a little surprised that his first move is to diss the people he might be hiring 5 years from now.</p> 
     <p>(And why is he using that image of what looks like it can only be a geek deep in the &#8220;zone&#8221;? Is it aspirational or dismissive? Is it Clark himself? Who knows.)</p> 
     <p><b>To be clear: It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m an evangelizing fan of the term &#8220;creative technologist&#8221;.</b> Any term with the word &#8220;creative&#8221; or &#8220;innovation&#8221; in it comes pre-packaged with a bad smell to me. But as someone making art with code AND teaching workshops showing other people to do the same I can&#8217;t help but wonder if I should be insulted by Clark&#8217;s post. It&#8217;s self-evident that we need better work to be made, but that&#8217;s true always and forever. I doubt anyone has ever looked around and said &#8220;I think we&#8217;re perfect, let&#8217;s not get any better than this.&#8221;</p> 
     <p>So how do we get there? Does anyone believe we can skip the larval stage completely and have creative coders popping up perfectly formed? I too am annoyed by facile interactive cliches and agencies who think they can be brilliant without having any real understanding of the tools or process of interaction design. I just don&#8217;t think turning one&#8217;s back on a nascent scene will help much.</p>
