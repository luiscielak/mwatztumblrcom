<p>This is the archive of "Thoughts on Code and Art" (mwatz.tumblr.com). Active from October 2011 until its unceremonious deletion in July 2012, the blog served as an outlet for random thoughts on computational aesthetics and my own art practice.

 <h3>mwatz.tumblr.com: About</h3>
   
<p>"Thoughts on Code and Art" (mwatz.tumblr.com) was registered on Tumblr in September 2008. It remained dormant until October 2011 when I decided that a blog might be a useful tool (again.) </p>
<p>My previous blogging experience consisted of writing the <a href="http://generatorx.no">Generator.x blog</a> (active 2005-2008), an endeavour resulting in personal satisfaction as well as a measure of professional impact. Written in an impersonal and pseudo-academic voice, Generator.x was created to promote a conference (held at Atelier Nord, Oslo, 2005) and subsequent events (an audiovisual concert tour, the Generator.x 2.0 digital fabrication workshop at Club Transmediale, Berlin, 2008.) But more significantly, it became the primary vessel for the articulation of a theoretical framework for the project.</p>
<p>The central topic of Generator.x was the integration of generative logic and computational methodology in creative practices, as well as the aesthetic artifacts and strategies resulting from this hybridization. Generator.x posited that this integration not only represented a significant creative potential, but that it had already become the de facto locus of new trends rapidly emerging across the disciplines of art, design and architecture. </p>
<p>Data visualization, parametric modeling and generative art are not new ideas. Historical precedents are plentiful - from John Cage and the early age of computing in the 1960's, to the Jacquard loom and even back to ancient history. The creation of custom software systems has always been central to media art, though primarily as a means to an end and not as a focus of aesthetic exploration. Nevertheless, the mid-2000's should be considered a tipping point where computational logic finally gained popular recognition, fueled by the ubiquity of digital media and &quot;gateway drugs&quot; like HTML, Javascript and Actionscript - providing many creatives with a first taste of coded logic (despite their many imperfections.)</p>
<p>The 2000's saw a proliferation of tools (Processing, VVVV, OpenFrameworks, PD, Arduino) specifically designed to enable designers and artists to experiment with code and generative logic. By lowering technical thresholds and simplifying the basic realities of programming these tools allowed for naive experimentation, making them excellent educational aids. But they were also powerful enough to be used for professional production. a supportive global community based on code sharing and a public discourse for new ideas. The evolution of this community was crucially enabled by blogs and other social media channels (Twitter, Flickr and video sharing sites). Self-publication remains the most significant stimulant of Internet culture, and the generative art / creative code scene is no exception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>saw an explosion </p>
<p>but which I thought were wo.  Like most blogs Generator.x eventually went into hibernation, partly due to new blogs emerging to cover the same topics while my own posts became increasingly more ambitious and time-consuming, leading to a common-sense cost/benefit analysis resulting in the eventual discontinuation of the blog.</p>
<p>Still: Once a blogger, always a blogger. &quot;Thoughts on Code and Art&quot; was a product of my interest in the rise of the Tumblr platform, as well as the impulse to blog that had never gone away. </p>
<p>The rise of Tumblr intrigued me, even though the vast majority of all Tumblrs bore little resemblance to the long-form, personality-driven blogging that I knew as a vital force from the mid-2000's.</p>
<p>My intentions with "Thoughts on Code and Art"   driven by my previous experiences using the <a href="http://generatorx.no">Generator.x blog</a> (active 2005-2008) as a means to popularize ideas around generative art</p>
