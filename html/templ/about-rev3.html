<p>This is the archive of "Thoughts on Code and Art" (mwatz.tumblr.com). Active from October 2011 until its unceremonious deletion in July 2012, the blog served as an outlet for random thoughts on computational aesthetics and my own art practice.

 <h3>mwatz.tumblr.com: About</h3>
   
<p>"Thoughts on Code and Art" (mwatz.tumblr.com) was registered on Tumblr in September 2008. The blog remained dormant until October 2011, at which point I decided that a blog might be a useful tool (again.) The following is a rambling account of my reasons for creating the blog. A malapropos bonus: An inadvertent history account of Generator.x.</p>
<p><strong>My previous blogging experience consisted of writing the <a href="http://generatorx.no">Generator.x blog</a> </strong>(active 2005-2008), through which I achieved both personal satisfaction and a measure of professional impact. Written in an impersonal and pseudo-academic voice, Generator.x was created to promote a conference and exhibition about generative art and computational design (held respectively at Atelier Nord and The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, 2005) as well as subsequent events (an audiovisual concert tour, various locations, Generator.x 2.0 workshop on digital fabrication, Club Transmediale, Berlin 2008.) </p>
<p>The central topic of Generator.x was the integration of generative logic and computational methodology in creative practices as well as new aesthetic artifacts and strategies produced as a consequence. Generator.x posited that this integration not only represented a significant creative potential, but that it had become the de facto locus of a range of new trends emerging across the disciplines of art, design and architecture. As a promotional tool the blog performed beyond expectations, generating plenty of attention with no financial investment. (The time investment was considerable, but time spent inevitably becomes a soft cost when working on a limited budget.) </p>
<p><strong>The Generator.x blog let me articulate a theoretical framework </strong>for the project, sometimes in ways I had not anticipated at the outset. My initial posts consisted of unremarkable link-blogging, but I gradually came to realize that the blog format could be used to work out my arguments in an incremental fashion (literally post by post). This eliminated the pressure of having to write a monolithic and definitive text slash manifesto, even allowing a certain margin of error in the event of conceptual missteps. Writing the blog was a way to think aloud (albeit in an authorative voice) and publicly beta-test ideas that were still works-in-progress. </p>
<p>A text written according to academic principles is expected to be a definitive document. In contrast, a blog is typically an explorative narrative whose evolution over time is not only accepted but expected. Bloggers even have the luxury of reader feedback, provided through actual comments or less directly by statistics showing which posts are popular with readers. Note that this feedback loop comes with inherent flaws, comments are usually limited in number and thus do not represent a statistically sound reference. They can also tempt the writer to please his audience and override critical instinct.  Cognizant of these facts I was nonetheless happy to embrace the benefits of blogging, especially since my academic credentials are in fact limited.</p>
<p>Generator.x blog remained active after the curated events came to a conclusion. Posts became less frequent but also grew increasingly ambitious in scope, a consequence of accumulated writing experience and narrowing of conceptual focus. Like most blogs it did eventually arrive at a natural terminus, ironically partly due to the success of the ideas it argued. By 2008 the central tenets of Generator.x had become self-evident facts, achieving a popular penetration demonstrated by an emerging network of blogs, backed up by an explosive increase in projects exploring generative strategies. </p>
<p><strong>My creation of mwatz.tumblr.com was heavily influenced</strong> by my experience writing the Generator.x blog. Specifically: A. A successful blog is a powerful tool for the public articulation of ideas and can become a channel for propaganda and subjective narratives. B. A blog requires significant time investment to achieve popular impact and conceptual &quot;escape velocity&quot; (i.e. the point at which it gains some degree of power to affect public discourse or at the very least legitimize the position being argued by its writer.) C. The vitality and potential impact of a blog is inextricably linked to the &quot;voice&quot; of the writer, whether impersonal or personal, pseudo-objective or subjective to the point of eccentricity. The potential audience of a given blog oftem constitute an extreme niche interest or are the result of a current meme, but a blog's ability to sustain interest (aka &quot;stickyness&quot; in adspeak) is always based on continuous posting schedules and the potential of a given post to engage the reader by providing exclusive information or analysis not available elsewhere. Like newspapers before them, blogs often become entangled in market evaluation based on scarcity and novelty, information i s</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In shifting my focus back to my own art production and de-emphasizing Generator.x as a major activity the blog proved to be a distracting time-sink and even somewhat problematic. The art world frowns on the mixing of roles, and not without reason. Artists who take up curating or critical writing might do so with the purest of motives, but such activities inevitably face a significant conflict of interest: Any curating decision or conceptual argument they make are likely to be colored (consciously or not) by the artist's own practice and professional ambitions. Most notoriously, their efforts can be flawed by nepotism and the temptation to promote the artist's own work. </p>
<p>I would like to think that in curating Generator I managed to steer clear of such pitfalls .x, but 20-20 hindsight usually provides a clarity and perspective that might not have been available at the time decision was made. In that light, I'll freely admit to making certain choices that retrospectively seem flawed </p>
<p></p>
<p>Curating Generator.x was always intended as a time-limited means to an end, a tool to promote ideas I considered to have significant transformative potential despite being undervalued (and even dismissed) by the current media art discourse. But my motive for creating the project was not simple altruism. The impetus for Generator.x stemmed from my frustration with the lack of recognition of generative art, matched with the desire to provide an arena for public discourse and simultaneously jump-start a global network of code-based artists whose work deserved public attention. But I also knew that, if successful, Generator.x would serve to legitimize and popularize an artistic position that my own work was aligned with. </p>
<p>Generator.x ended up achieving all the objectives I had hoped it might, aided by trends beyond the project itself. Computational aesthetics </p>
