 <h3>mwatz.tumblr.com: About</h3>
   
<p>This is the archive of &quot;Thoughts on Code and Art&quot; (mwatz.tumblr.com). Active from October 2011 until its unceremonious deletion in July 2012, the blog served as an outlet for random thoughts on computational aesthetics and my own art practice. I am providing this archive (unedited despite containing plenty of mistakes and laughable naivete) for three reasons: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Some people have asked to do so. </li>
  <li>A handful of posts did end up being quoted elsewhere, often in texts more deserving of consideration than the original post. Deleting the blog took those posts offline, taking away the context of any such quote or reference.</li>
      <li>I believe that online texts (even if inane, flawed in logic or instantly outdated) are part of a larger hypertext narrative. </li>
  </ol>
<p>Also: Link rot sucks, even more so for texts that were never published digitally. I personally enjoy reading historical texts of an informal, subjective, non-academic or less than canon-worthy nature. (I.e. blog posts, artist statements, exhibition catalogues, USENET discussions, FAQs etc.) Such texts can provide historical context or of-the-moment commentary often missing from &quot;official&quot; retrospective accounts (especially since such accounts tend to edit and select a narrative suitable to their own objectives.) </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thoughts on Code and Art&quot; was never intended</strong> to be a document of any consequence. It was created as an experimental outlet for random personal thoughts surrounding my work. The eventual decision to delete the blog was a combination of common blogger's ennui and the desire to eliminate a time-sucking distraction of dubious professional significance. </p>
<p>My belief in the blog's usefulness and my own motives for writing it also dwindled over time, informed in part by a small amount of community blowback in response to certain posts . But more significant was the painful and gradual realization that an occasionally text-heavy blog risks becoming a &quot;dead media&quot; model whose golden era (mid- to late-2000's) had passed. Blogs are time-consuming and slow-moving, especially when compared to the contemporary model of &quot;content curation&quot; posting on Twitter or Instagram, re-blogging links and images on Tumblr or Pinterest etc. </p>
<p>All ideas have their moment. Nostalgia is rarely helpful . Kill your darlings, move on.</p>
