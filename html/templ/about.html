 <h3>mwatz.tumblr.com: About</h3>
   
<p>This is an archive of &quot;Thoughts on Code and Art&quot; (mwatz.tumblr.com). Active from October 2011 until its unceremonious deletion in July 2012, the blog served as an outlet for random thoughts on computational aesthetics and my own art practice. I am providing this archive  (unedited despite glaring writing mistakes or flawed arguments, made obvious by the blinding light of hindsight) for three reasons: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A handful of people have requested such an archive. </li>
  <li>A few posts has been quoted elsewhere, often in texts more deserving of consideration than the original post. The deletion of the blog made those posts unavailable as original sources for such references.</li>
      <li>I believe that all online texts (even when inane, flawed in logic or instantly outdated) are nodes in a larger hypertext narrative. In an ideal world, such texts should be preserved even when outdated and obsolete, becoming snapshots of micro-history for future re-interpretation and data mining. Blogs usually come to an end, trends / movements / memes are typically finite in time. But content is forever.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Corollary: Link rot sucks. The disappearance of information (however trivial) is synonymous to damage to a hypothetical hypertext slash hive mind, of which the Internet is the latest incarnation. I would also include the loss of texts that were never published digitally, the hardcopies of which either become &quot;collectable&quot; or simply irrelevant. </p>
<p>Obviously, the notion of a hyper-network of knowledge comprised of all information ever published is bot utopian and ignorant of real-life causalities. But the Web might just prove to be the first instance of such a hypertext. Digital information requiring minimal </p>
<p>The <a href="http://archive.org/">Wayback machine </a>famously allows the recovery of historic web content, but it's hardly convenient or fool-proof. A </p>
<p>The Web is a conveniently plastic and impermanent channel, always editable and remixable. This plasticity is a GOOD THING. But it can also lead would-be authors into temptation, justifying the retro-active editing and even deletion of published materials that somehow are found to be lacking or flawed. Such impulses are aided by the inevitable need to  restructure and restyle existing content, a process </p>
<p>Personally I try to follow a principle of keeping material online , (Obviously, a hypothetical no-edit ideal would not apply to indices of current information, nor any underlying technical infrastucture required to present or access information.)</p>
<p>I often find historical texts of an informal, subjective, non-academic or less than canon-worthy nature. (I.e. blog posts, artist statements, exhibition catalogues, USENET discussions, FAQs etc.) Such texts can provide historical context or of-the-moment commentary often missing from &quot;official&quot; retrospective accounts (especially since such accounts tend to edit and select a narrative suitable to their own objectives.) </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thoughts on Code and Art&quot; was never intended</strong> to be a document of any consequence. It was created as an experimental outlet for random personal thoughts surrounding my work. The eventual decision to delete the blog was a combination of common blogger's ennui and the desire to eliminate a time-sucking distraction of dubious professional significance. </p>
<p>My belief in the blog's usefulness and my own motives for writing it also dwindled over time, informed in part by a small amount of community blowback in response to certain posts . But more significant was the painful and gradual realization that an occasionally text-heavy blog risks becoming a &quot;dead media&quot; model whose golden era (mid- to late-2000's) had passed. Blogs are time-consuming and slow-moving, especially when compared to the contemporary model of &quot;content curation&quot; posting on Twitter or Instagram, re-blogging links and images on Tumblr or Pinterest etc. </p>
<p>All ideas have their moment. Nostalgia is rarely helpful . Kill your darlings, move on.</p>
